1.  The user opens the calculator. They want to find the result of a couple different calculations. First they want to find the sine of 45 degrees. They 
enter in "sin(45)" to the calculator expecting to see sqrt(2)/2. Instead they see a different result. They realize that the calculator was set in radian mode by 
default. The user then goes into the menu settings to change the calculator into degree mode. In doing so, they calculate sin(45) once again and they get the expected 
result of sqrt(2)/2. Now they have a basic system of linear equations with equation 1 being "2x + 3y = 4" and equation 2 is "6y = 2". Knowing how to solve this, the 
user creates variable y by press the "y" key on they keyboard and then follows it with the variable setting button showing "y -> " and then inputs "2/6". Then they 
solve for x in the first equation with "x = (4 - 3y)/2". They type the left hand side of the equation into the calculator and the result of "3/2" appears on the screen.
The user is now done with the calculator and closes the application.

2. The user opens the calculator and sees the calcutors open on the standard calculation screen. They want to graph some functions so they press the button that switches 
the calculator into graphing mode. A screen with a blank graph is now on the screen waiting for the first function to be inputted. They start with the basic function of 
f(x) = x^2. After pressing enter, a parabola apprears on the graph. Then they press tab to input another function and the calculator waits for the next function. Then 
they input the function f(x) = x. On the same graph, a linear line is displayed. The user wants to find the intersections of the two graphs so in a menu they press the 
intersection button. The user drags their mouse to the graph and a vertical line follows the cursor waiting for the input of the first x postion of an interval. First 
they place the cursor on x = -1 and click which makes the first interval of the intersection function be x = -1. Then they drag the cursor over to x = 0.5 and click. A
dot appears on the graph at (0,0) showing that there is an intersection at (0,0) of the functions f(x) = x^2 and f(x) = x. The user wants to find the other intersection
so they follow the same process clicking on the screen at x = 0.5 and x = 2. Another dot appears at (1,,1) showing there is a second intersection at (1,1). Now the user 
decides they don't want f(x) = x^2 to be displayed on the graph so the click on the parabola which bolds the line and they press the delete key on their keyboard. The 
graph now only show f(x) = x. The user then closes the calculator.

3. The user opens the calculator and wants to find the result of 3 equations in a system of linear equations. This time they decide they want to use a matrix. They have 
the equations "3x + 2y + 5z = 1", "7z + 5y = 6", and "2x -4 + 8y + 5z = 0". The user knows that they will need a 3x4 matrix because there are 3 equations and 3 unknowns.
The 4th column on the 2nd dimension is for the constants. The user types "rref" and then presses the matrix button. A prompt appears asking what size matrix the user 
wants so they input 3 rows and 4 columns. A 3x4 matrix appears on the screen next to the letters "rref". The matrix has boxes in each cell indicating they need an input. 
The user fills the matrix with [3, 2, 5, 1, 0, 5, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 4] (following left to right and top to bottom). Then the user presses the equal sign on the screen to 
find the result. An error message appears saying "Missing (". Since rref is a function, it must have an opening parenthesis to call the function. The user moves the 
cursor in front of the opening bracket of the matrix and adds the (. A shadow of ) appears on the opposite side of the matrix. The user presses enter and another matrix 
is displayed. [1, 0 , 0 , -21/23, 0, 1 , 0 , 8/23, 0, 0, 1, 14/23] indicating that x = -21/23, y = 8/23, and z = 14/23. The user wants the answers in demical instead of 
fractions so they scroll up to the previous result and presses enter to copy it to the current line. The user goes into a menu to find a function that converts fraction 
to decimal and presses enter. Next to the matric "-> Decimal" appears and they press enter. Another matrix appears [1, 0 , 0 , -0.913043, 0, 1 , 0 , 0.347826, 0, 0, 1, 
0.608696] indicating the answers being turned into decimal form. The user closes the calcualtor.
